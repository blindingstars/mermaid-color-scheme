# Unmaintained!

I've moved on from HexChat to Textual and have created a [new color scheme](https://github.com/blindingstars/Riptide) there. Leaving this repo here for preservation, but it will not be receiving updates.

Color scheme for Sublime Text and HexChat

Admittedly, this is a totally personal color scheme and I don't expect it to perfectly fit the needs of others, but just in case, enjoy!

## Sublime Text

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) theme created on [TmThemeEditor](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com) and loosely based on [Base16 Ocean Dark](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#ocean) (hence the ocean-y theme here!). Looks great with [Spacegray](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/), which I highly recommend.

## HexChat

[HexChat](http://hexchat.github.io/) color scheme has some deviations from the Sublime Text theme for a bit more variation if you use colored nicks, but background, foreground, selection, and many of the colors still match.
